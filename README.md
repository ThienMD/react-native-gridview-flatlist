# react-native-gridview-flatlist
Inspire reactnative gridview. 

This component allows to display a grid/collection of items with more than one item per row. The items per row is configurable and it uses a 'FlatList' in order to have a proper recycle mechanism.

Flat list is more performance, easy customize than listview.

# Getting started
